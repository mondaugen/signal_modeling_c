% Accepts the output of rlspykas in analysis configuration and checks the
% stability of the coefficients at each time step. If these coefficients are
% deemed to be unstable, the polynomial represented by the coefficients is
% factorized, the unstable roots are replaced by their conjugated inverse and
% the new stable poles are output.
%
% In any case, the coefficients are output in a form suitable for
% Octave/MATLAB's "filter" function. Concerning the coefficient output B of the
% rlspyk filter program, the output of this program, which is of the suitable
% form is [1; -B], followed by one sample of the residual e.
